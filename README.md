# Particle Filter SLAM


<h1><b> Objective </b></h1>
The objective of this project is to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using a combination of encoder and IMU odometry, 2-D LiDAR scans, and RGBD measurements from a differential-drive robot. The project aims to utilize the odometry and LiDAR measurements to accurately localize the robot and construct a detailed 2-D occupancy grid map of the surrounding environment. Additionally, the project aims to leverage RGBD images to assign colors to the generated 2-D map, providing visual representation of the floor in the mapping process.
